    <p style="background-color:rgba(255,99,71,0.5)">gene mutation :This can be defined as a change to a gene's DNA sequence to produce something different. It creates a permanent change to that gene's DNA sequence. Genetic variations are important for humans to evolve, which is the process of change over generations.</p>

    <p class="firstClass">1.Germline mutations occur in gametes. Somatic mutations occur in other body cells.<br>
        2.Chromosomal alterations are mutations that change chromosome structure.<br>
       3.Point mutations change a single <strong>nucleotide.</strong><br>
       4.Frameshift mutations are additions or deletions of nucleotides that cause a shift in the reading frame.</p>
